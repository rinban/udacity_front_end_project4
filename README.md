## Getting started

Before start running the tool, you have to download the dependency packages to make sure the tool will work.

The installation command is: 

```
npm install <package name>
```

After the installation for all packages, use the following command to start the developer server. This should open a new window in your browser with the app running on localhost:8080

```
npm run build-dev
```

you can also run the production server (with express), by typing these commands:

```
npm run build-prod
npm run start
```
The first command will create a `dist` folder with the built code.
